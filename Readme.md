# Warcraft III Rampage Maps

Maps where you direct a giant monster to crush and devour (almost) everything. Press an arrow key once to move, press the same direction again to stop.

Built off version 1.26.0.6401 of the classic edition.

The sound resources and Rampage Objects file are not necessary to play. Maps are standalone.
